# Genetic-Net
Next Steps:
* sort Neuron execution Order by ??? Algorithm (needed?)
* add Synapses
* add Neurons
* remove Synapses
* remove Neurons
* add Memory-Neuron Types
  * separate last Output/ actual Output
  * Neuron-Type: fade out Output Memory-Neurons
  * Neuron-Type: Flip-Flop Memory-Neurons (Trigger for new Output)
  ** more than one input Type needed
  * Neuron-Type: Memory Chain (First In / Last Out) Memory-Neurons

# Simple Gridworld
Next Steps:
* 4x4 board
* train with static environment, static player
* train with static environment, player placed randomly
* train with random environment, player placed randomly

# Complex Gridworld
Next Steps:
* Player: turn his direction and move are seperated actions

# Hex Gridworld
Next Steps:

# Hex Gridworld
Next Steps:
* Player see only Bord in front of his view Direction

# Long Term Ideas
* mutation rate of brain regions (connected to special neurons?) depends on ???
* add backpropagation training for special brain regions
  * allows learning while individuals life
  * Bewertungsfunktion wird genetisch ermittelt
